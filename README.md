## Description

Sunscan is a spectroheliograph designed to capture images of the Sun in minutes, directly from a smartphone. This complete and autonomous device is the result of several months of work by the STAROS team (Guillaume Bertrand, Christian Buil, Val√©rie Desnoux, Olivier Garde, Matthieu Le Lain).

The Sunscan backend provides server-side functionality for the Sunscan application. It handles image processing, data management, and serves as the API for the frontend application.

## Features

- Control Sunscan via smartphone or tablet
- Capture solar images showing prominences, flares, and sunspots
- Intuitive interface requiring no special knowledge
- Server-side image processing and data management

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sunscan-backend.git
   cd sunscan-backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv --system-site-packages venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install gcc python3-dev
   sudo apt-get install -y libcap-dev libcamera-dev python3-libcamera python3-pyqt5 python3-prctl libatlas-base-dev ffmpeg
   pip install -r app/requirements.txt
   sudo apt-get install uvicorn
   ```

## Configuration

1. Copy the example configuration file:
   ```
   cp config.example.py config.py
   ```

2. Edit `config.py` to set up your specific configuration parameters if needed.

## Running the Server

The Sunscan backend is a FastAPI application that uses Uvicorn as the ASGI server.

To start the backend server:

1. Ensure you're in the project directory and your virtual environment is activated (if you're using one).

2. Run the following command:
   ```
   cd app
   python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

   ```

   This command does the following:
   - `app.main` refers to the `main.py` file in the `app` directory
   - `:app` refers to the FastAPI instance in the `main.py` file
   - `--reload` enables auto-reloading, which is useful during development

   ```
   # or just launch the start script
   ./start.sh
   ```

3. The server should start and display a message indicating it's running, along with the address and port (e.g., "Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000").

4. You can now access the API endpoints using this address.

Note: Make sure all required environment variables are set and the database is properly configured before starting the server. Refer to the configuration section for more details.

## Hotspot

Configure the hotspot by the script:
```
sudo  system/usr/local/bin/configure_hotspot.sh
```


## Mobile Application

An open-source mobile application, built using Expo, is currently under development to control the Sunscan instrument. You can find the application repository at: [https://github.com/staros-projects/sunscan-app](https://github.com/staros-projects/sunscan-app)
